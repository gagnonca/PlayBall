## PlayBall — Fair Play, Fun Play, Every Game

PlayBall is the coach‑in‑your‑pocket that makes equal playing time simple, so you can focus on teaching skills and cheering your kids on.

Key features:
- **Manage multiple teams** – create, edit, or delete team rosters and keep them organized in one place.
- **Game-day rosters made easy** – select which players are available and automatically build balanced game rotations.
- **Fair play scheduling** – substitution charts ensure equal playing time for every player, regardless of roster size.
- **Game editing tools** – update game details, adjust rosters, and refine substitution plans quickly.
- **Save and reuse** – teams and games are stored locally, so you can revisit past games and track rosters over time.
- **Coach-friendly design** – simple menus, one-tap team switching, and clear substitution grids keep the focus on the field.
- **Built for 4v4 youth soccer**

All data lives on your device; no login, no ads ever, no subscriptions, no internet required at the field. I will never ask for a payment to unlock features in this app.

Whether you’re coaching your first season or juggling multiple teams, PlayBall gives every kid their fair shot—and gives you more time to enjoy the game.

## Dedication 
PlayBall is built with love for everyone who volunteers their time to youth sports. The name *PlayBall* is a tribute to my dad, who coached me throughout my childhood and taught me the importance of fair play and equal playing time for every kid.
